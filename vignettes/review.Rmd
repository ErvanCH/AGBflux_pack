I wrote this review as a vignette. When you are done reading it, you can remove it simply by deleting `vignettes/`.




# Installation

```{r}
library(devtools)
```

Installs OK.

```{r}
install_github("ervanSTRI/AGBflux_pack")
```

# Goal

* Searching for documentation at the package level:

```{r}
library(AGBfluxes)
?AGBflux_pack
```

Needs package documentation (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html#man-packages)



* Searching for help file of any function:

    * Typing on the console `AGBflux_pack::` + tab: Nothing pops up. 
    
I'm wondering if the package has any function which help file is available.

Now jumping to the source code to see if there is a man/ folder with documentation.

Yes, there is documentation.

```
?AGB.comp
?flag.errors
?LOAD
```



# Checks

Run `devtools::check()` (find "Check" in the Build tab) and address errors, warnings and notes.

## Notes

The DESCRIPTON file  has a problem:

```
checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... NOTE
Malformed Title field: should not end in a period.
```

To solve it, remove the period at the end of the sentence you wrote on the Title field. Also consider this (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html)

    * shorten the sentence to 80 characters or less.
    * use Title Type Capitalization

Also, the Licence field has a problem:

```
Non-standard license specification:
  What license is it under?
Standardizable: FALSE
```

This should guide you to solve it:

> The License field can be either a standard abbreviation for an open source license, like GPL-2 or BSD, or a pointer to a file containing more information, file LICENSE. The license is really only important if you're planning on releasing your package. If you don't, you can ignore this section. If you want to make it clear that your package is not open source, use License: file LICENSE and then create a file called LICENSE, containing for example:

```
Proprietary 

Do not distribute outside of Widgets Incorporated.
```

## Warnings

This information helps you solve a number of issues. I'll mention a couple of important ones. You'll be able to work out the rest. (If the information is unclear, you may find more details here; http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html)

In the documentation of some function, some parameters that those functions use remain undocumented. One good way to not any important piece of documentation is to step on the function's name and press Ctrl + Shift + Alt + R. That will automatically write the roxygen skeleton of key documentation inluding all parameters. If you need to use the same  parameter in multiple functions, you may avoid duplicating its documentation with [@template](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html).

Also, you need to rename sume functions. For example, if you rename  `density.ind()` as `density_ind()` you will avoid R thinking that `density.ind()` is an S3 method of the generic function `density()` (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#s3). Again, that is why it is safer to avoid "." in function names, unless you intend to wirite an S3 object.






# Tests

You are already testing, but in a non-systematic way: you write a function, run it, and see its output  on the console to check check if it's right. If do this systematically, with an automatic unit testing system such as the __[testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/testthat.pdf)__ package, you will save you a lot of time. This type of test is for you, the developer. 

Another type of test are assertions, which you can implement with e.g. the __[assertive](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/assertive/assertive.pdf)__ package. Assertions target not the developer but the user; they err, warn of give messages to the user when something is wrong or suspicious. 

This are good resources to learn more about unit tests and assertions:

# Author

If the author of the package is the author of a function, then that author needs not to be explicitely mentioned in each help file. 

In other words, use \@author in help files of functions written but people other than the authors of the package.




# Style

Use a style guide, e.g. 

* http://style.tidyverse.org/ (the one I use).
* https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml.

> Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and _.

> Use underscores (_) to separate words within a name. Base R uses dots in function names (contrib.url()) and class names (data.frame), but itâ€™s better to reserve dots exclusively for the S3 object system. In S3, methods are given the name function.class; if you also use . in function and class names you end up with confusing methods like as.data.frame.data.frame().
